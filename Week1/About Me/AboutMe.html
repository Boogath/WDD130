        <h2>Jacob Madsen</h2>
        <p>I am working on a computer programming degree. 
            I have been married almost 11 years. We have 2 children, 
            9 months apart and they are both adorable and monsters. 
            We enjoy camping, movies, lounging around the house and being with family.
            I work for eBay's Social Media department answering customer service questions
            about buying and selling. I have been taking computer programming classes for
            some time now and can code in 6 different languages (basic knowledge). You 
            have to attend BYU Idaho to get a programming degree, so my bachelors will 
            likely be something like Computer Science > Applied Technology. Web Design is 
            a required course in this and I look forward to learning more. I honestly hope 
            to learn enough about web developement to maybe even start working in such a 
            field to get more experience under my belt. I do have a programming certificate 
            from BYU Idaho and look forward to finally getting a bachelors. I have been a 
            member of the church for my entire life and served an LDS mission in Santiago, Chile 
            back in 2001-2003.

        <h3>One of my favorite quotes is from Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf:</h3>
        <h4>
            <li>No matter how bleak the chapter of our lives may look today, 
                because of the life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
                we may hope and be assured that the ending of the book of our lives will 
                exceed our grandest expectations.</li>
        </h4>
