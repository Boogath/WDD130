          <p>Unique and local experience beside the major tourist destinations. Sometimes less is more!  I have the ins 
            and outs and I know you will have a great time and do the things you want to do find those hidden treasures 
            and extra activities you don't think about. </p>
          <p>Provide hassle free vacation bookings, let me handle all the hard work. You sit back and I’ll take care of you. 
            I focus on getting to the place that really matters and meeting the people that know how to have a good time. 
            Sometimes it’s not just seeing Stone Hedge, but hearing from the locals on how they have come to learn to 
            appreciate it and what it means to them. Sure, they give you the general knowledge at a tour site, but imagine 
            taking a tour from someone who appreciates it in a different way.

            <!-- <p>Unique and local experience beside the major tourist destinations. Sometimes less is more!  I have the ins 
              and outs and I know you will have a great time and do the things you want to do find those hidden treasures

            <p>I find custom locations found so you don't have to. Such as restaurants, recreation centers, museums, 
              places of worship etc. I don’t just search the standard sites to visit, as I know you will want to get to 
              know the area you’re visiting and experience the love locals have for their area, country, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>Visiting a location and seeing it for the first time is left to one own’s interpretation. A tour guide 
              will tell you a general knowledge of the subject, but locals who live with it, walk past it, use it on a 
              regular basis, they have so much more to tell, without holding back. You can find these individuals and 
              that’s where I am different than anyone else. I use my connection with Facebook and knowledge of searching 
              popular opinion through social media to get you the best places to visit, and where around that area is 
              the hidden treasure.

          <p>Courtney found me this amazing, out in the country, 
            Air B n B and she went out of her way to ensure I had a 
            safe time, a guide, and I got to do what I have always 
            wanted to do, which was to shop the street vendors without 
            getting ripped off or cheated.
          </p>
          <p>I loved our family vacation. Instead of taking a really 
            expensive route, Courtney found us a hotel off the beaten 
            path that made it affordable and we got to still visit the 
            sites we wanted and do more. She really saved us money.
          </p> 
            I wanted a peaceful trip with my two dogs and Courtney 
            did all the hard work of finding pet friendly locations 
            and even some pet friendly parks near our stay. She really 
            pulled through on this one.
