          <p>Courtney found me this amazing, out in the country, 
            Air B n B and she went out of her way to ensure I had a 
            safe time, a guide, and I got to do what I have always 
            wanted to do, which was to shop the street vendors without 
            getting ripped off or cheated.
          </p>
          <p>I loved our family vacation. Instead of taking a really 
            expensive route, Courtney found us a hotel off the beaten 
            path that made it affordable and we got to still visit the 
            sites we wanted and do more. She really saved us money.
          </p> 
            I wanted a peaceful trip with my two dogs and Courtney 
            did all the hard work of finding pet friendly locations 
            and even some pet friendly parks near our stay. She really 
            pulled through on this one.
