        <p>Provide hassle free vacation bookings, let me handle all the hard work. You sit back and I’ll take care of you. I focus on getting to the place that really matters and meeting the people that know how to have a good time. Sometimes it’s not just seeing Stone Hedge, but hearing from the locals on how they have come to learn to appreciate it and what it means to them. Sure, they give you the general knowledge at a tour site, but imagine taking a tour from someone who appreciates it in a different way. </p>

        <p>Unique and local experience beside the major tourist destinations. Sometimes less is more!  I have the ins and outs and I know you will have a great time and do the things you want to do find those hidden treasures and extra activities you don't think about. </p>

        <p>I find custom locations found so you don't have to. Such as restaurants, recreation centers, museums, places of worship etc. I don’t just search the standard sites to visit, as I know you will want to get to know the area you’re visiting and experience the love locals have for their area, country, etc. </p>

        <p>Visiting a location and seeing it for the first time is left to one own’s interpretation. A tour guide will tell you a general knowledge of the subject, but locals who live with it, walk past it, use it on a regular basis, they have so much more to tell, without holding back. You can find these individuals and that’s where I am different than anyone else. I use my connection with Facebook and knowledge of searching popular opinion through social media to get you the best places to visit, and where around that area is the hidden treasure. </p>

        <p>Reviews: 
        Courtney found me this amazing, out in the country, Air B n B and she went out of her way to ensure I had a safe time, a guide, and I got to do what I have always wanted to do, which was to shop the street vendors without getting ripped off or cheated. 
        I loved our family vacation. Instead of taking a really expensive route, Courtney found us a hotel off the beaten path that made it affordable and we got to still visit the sites we wanted and do more. She really saved us money. 
        I wanted a peaceful trip with my two dogs and Courtney did all the hard work of finding pet friendly locations and even some pet friendly parks near our stay. She really pulled through on this one.</p>

        <p>FAQ’s: 
        How do we pay you? 
        You present what you want to do, how much your budget is and how much spending money you want. I find, within your budget, a place to stay, and some suggestions on what you can do within your budget. Sharing your interests with me is key, as I want you to do what you want, when you want, and how you want. 
        What happens if we miss a flight? 
        Our policy is we will do what ever we can. There needs to be some responsibility for being the ones that miss the flight, but we will pull what ever strings we can to ensure either a change or something to work out with the airlines. </p>
