      <p class="question">How do we pay you?</p>
      <p>You present what you want to do, how much your budget 
        is and how much spending money you want. I find, within 
        your budget, a place to stay, and some suggestions on 
        what you can do within your budget. Sharing your interests 
        with me is key, as I want you to do what you want, when you 
        want, and how you want.

      <p class="question">What happens if we miss a flight?</p>      
      <p>Our policy is we will do what ever we can. 
        There needs to be some responsibility for being the ones 
        that miss the flight, but we will pull what ever strings 
        we can to ensure either a change or something to work out 
        with the airlines.
