      <p>Hello and Welcome!</p>
      <p>My name is Courtney and I love all things travel. I have a talent for planning great adventures both abroad and close to home.</p>
      <p>I first got my love for traveling when my family would go on simple camping trips in the Uintah Mountain’s located in Utah, USA.</p>
      <img id="bryce" src="images/bryce-canyone.jpg" alt="vaction trip">
      <p>From there we would go on trips throughout Utah and surrounding states basking in the beauty, adventures, cultures, restaurants and more. 
        From there I have loved to travel throughout the USA and other amazing destinations in the best and affordable way possible. 
        When I have stumbled on a great restaurant, a hidden gem, antique shop or a homey AirBnB, it has made all the difference in my vacation. 
        That is why one of my specialties is providing a way to enjoy your vacation by booking and offering local experiences along with the common 
        tourist attractions.</p>
